<h2>about trk502x</h2>
<p>
  Benelli TRK 502X is a adventure bike available at a starting price of Rs. 6,13,025 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 4 colours. The Benelli TRK 502X is powered by 500cc BS6 engine which develops a power of 46.85 bhp and a torque of 46 Nm. With both front and rear disc brakes, Benelli TRK 502X comes up with anti-locking braking system. This TRK 502X bike weighs 235 kg and has a fuel tank capacity of 20 liters.

Benelli India has introduced the off-road biased TRK 502 X in the country to rival the likes of Suzuki V-Strom 650 XT and the Honda CB500X.

The BS6 variant of the middleweight adventure retains the styling cues from its predecessor. Thus, the motorcycle features a twin-pod headlight with LED DRLs, a beak-style design, a semi-fairing, knuckle guards with aluminium brackets, a tall-windscreen, and a split-seat setup. The TRK 502 X variant, similar to the road-biased TRK 502 BS6, gets an updated instrument cluster that features a revised layout. The updated model also benefits from backlit switchgear, adjustable handlebar, and redesigned mirrors.

The TRK 502 X will be available in three colours – Metallic Dark Grey, Pure White, and Benelli Red. The latter two carry a price premium of Rs 10,000 over the Metallic Dark Grey. The motorcycle comes with a three-year/unlimited kilometres warranty as standard.

The motorcycle is powered by a 500cc, parallel-twin, liquid-cooled engine that delivers 46.8bhp of maximum power at 8,500rpm and 46Nm of peak torque at 6,000rpm. The motor is linked to a six-speed gearbox.

The underpinnings remain similar to the BS4 version. Thus, the TRK 502 X BS6 continues to use a steel trellis frame. The suspension setup includes upside-down front forks and a rebound and preload-adjustable rear mono-shock. The anchoring duties are handled by twin, 320mm discs at the front and a single 260mm rotor at the back while the safety net includes dual-channel ABS. The motorcycle rides on a 19-inch front and 17-inch rear wire-spoke wheels. The road-biased TRK 502, for reference, uses 17-inch alloy wheels on both ends.
